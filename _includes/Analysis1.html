                <p>Firstly, we would like to understand if there is any perceivable correlation between the size of the brewery and the rating obtained by its products.</p>

                    <p>By performing a linear regression analysis, we can clearly see that there is a positive linear correlation between the size metric and the average rating. However, we must remain cautious with these results, as it is likely that other cofounders, not taken into account through our size metric, have though an impact on the average rating obtained by the breweries (it is possible that our size index does not explain everything).</p>
                    <p>To give statistical relevance to our first impression, we can coarsely divide our breweries into 3 size categories (<b>"small", "medium", "big"</b>). By computing the mean and standard deviation of the ratings for each one of the 3 categories, we can then perform an hypothesis testing to see if there is some statistical differencens in terms of ratings.</p>

                <div class="content is-marginless has-text-left ">
                    <p>By setting a null hypothesis \(H_0\): There is no statistically significant difference in average rating between the breweries size categories., we can perform a t-test analysis to see if the size category of a brewery impacts the average rate obtained:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> T-statistic: \(-23.2306\), P-value: \(0.00000000 \rightarrow\)  The difference in avg. rating is statistically significant between small and medium breweries.</li>
                        <li>T-statistic: \(-3.4624\), P-value: \(0.00077318 \rightarrow\) The difference in avg. rating is statistically significant between medium and big breweries.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It can be seen that belonging to a larger category tends to increase the average rating obtained significantly (at significance level \(0.05\)). An average rating difference of almost \(0.04\) can be observed between small and large breweries. However, we must be careful in drawing conclusions, as the standard deviation remains quite high.</p>
                    <p>To conclude, larger breweries obtain in average higher ratings and there are less differences in their ratings than for the smaller one. However by looking at the plot, we can see that some small breweries obtain very high ratings (and some even very low one), showing a more "extremal" behaviour than the one of larger breweries.</p>
                    <p>For example, the 15 breweries with highest average rating are all <code>small</code> breweries. That shows that despite the fact that bigger breweries have higher rating in average, the perceived quality of their products is not as high as the best small breweries. Therefore, being small-scaled can actually be an advantage for obtaining outstanding products. On the other side, larger breweries have in average better grades, but struggle to mantain top level beers.</p>

<!--                <p>Untill now we have only looked at the numerical rating. But a review is (usually) much more than just a number, and in every review there is a huge amount of information that can help us to measure the perceived quality of a product. For example, it would be interesting to assess if the brewery size impacts somehow on the average review length obtained by the breweries.</p>-->

<!--                <p>It may seem quite straightforward that the size of the brewery reviewed tends to bias the way in which the product is judged. Similarly to the ratings, one might expect positive and negative sentiments for small breweries to exhibit a relatively even distribution, ranging from very negative to very positive, influenced by different tastes and potentially more divisive flavour profiles. In contrast, for large breweries with a global presence, one might expect a tighter grouping of sentiment, indicating more refined and well-executed products.</p>-->

<!--                <p>the compound score derived from the <b>VADER</b> sentiment analysis. The composite score, ranging from -1 (indicating predominantly negative comments) to 1 (representing positive reviews), tends to show a broader spectrum for smaller breweries. This variation suggests that <b>reviews of smaller breweries cover a continuum of sentiment</b>, including both highly positive and potentially more critical comments.</p>-->
<!--                <p>In contrast, larger breweries tend to show a more focused trend of sentiments in their reviews. The average composite score for these establishments often approaches 1, indicating a prevalence of positivity in the overall sentiment expressed. This could mean that larger breweries receive a higher percentage of positive reviews on average, helping to consolidate sentiment towards the positive end of the spectrum. <b>The narrower range of scores suggests a more consistent pattern in the reviews of larger breweries, potentially indicating a more uniformly positive perception among customers</b> . The positivity perceived in reviews therefore seems to be very similar in terms of tendency to the rating.</p>-->

<!--                <p>Moving forward into our story, our next focus is to explore the <b>relative distance between the reviewer and the brewery for each review</b>. This analysis aims to provide insights into <b>how the popularity of a brewery is distributed globally.</b></p>-->
<!--                <p>The idea is to try to discern whether a small local brewery receives a majority of reviews from nearby users, or whether a world-renowned brewery receives international reviews, resulting in a higher average distance.</p>-->
<!--                <p>Since the vast majority of the reviewers are located in the USA, we restrain this analysis by considering only the breweries on the american ground. This is is necessary since the non-american breweries received most of their reviews from american people and thus their distance would be bigger.</p>-->

<!--                <p>The resulting plot is very interesting. We can see that a big portion of the small breweries has a mean distance to their reviewer close to zero, meaning that their reviewers are living in the same state. This is not the case for larger breweries, that seem to attract a more global panel of reviewers.</p>-->
